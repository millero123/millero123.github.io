    <h2>Costa Rica</h2>
    <p>I went to Costa Rica in 2021 for an end of year project for school. I spent timing surfing, hiking, and learning about the local culture. The city that I visted is called Tamarindo, and it is home to some of the best surfing in Costa Rica. The image on the right is a photo of a lizard that I took outside of our house.</p>

    <h2>Denmark</h2>
    <p>Two summers ago I visted Denmark with my mom. I had the oppertunity to stay in the heart of Copenhagen. I visited museums, parks, and even went to a concert when I was there. Copenhagen is a beautiful city and the people are friendly.</p>
