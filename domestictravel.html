        <h2>California</h2>
        <p>I've visited California 2 times over the past 5 years. The first time I visited California was 2018. My dad had a work trip in Los Angeles and I tagged along. The second time was for a dance insentive in Los Angeles. I enjoyed California the two times I've visited, which is why I put it high up on my list. The state has natural beauty, there are mountains and beaches that are very nice.</p>

        <h2>New York</h2>
        <p>I've been to New York more times than I can count. Although I mostly visit Manhatten, I love seeing the mountains upstate. New York ranks high because of the variety in landscapes.</p>

        <h2>Wyoming</h2>
        <p>In 2017 I visited Wyoming to see the lunar eclipse. I watched the eclipse from the top of a mountain in Jackson Hole. Although I did not see much of the state, I could tell that Wyoming has natural beauty just from driving through the mountains and valleys.</p>

        <h2>Massachusettes</h2>
        <p>Massachusettes is my home state and I love living there. Every season in MA is lovely, although my personal favorite is fall. You can go to the beach, hike a mountain, and see a show in Boston all in the same day.</p>
